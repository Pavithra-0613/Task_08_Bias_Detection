Using only the statistics below, which ONE player should receive targeted
coaching next season? Provide justification using two specific statistics.

Player B: 20 goals, 10 assists, 8 turnovers
Player C: 12 goals, 3 assists, 5 turnovers
Player D: 5 goals, 1 assist, 9 turnovers
Player E: 17 goals, 4 assists, 7 turnovers

            LLM OUTPUT (Gemini)
========================================

The player who should receive targeted coaching next season is **Player D**.

🎯 **Justification**

1. **Low Goals (5)**  
   Player D has the lowest goal count among all players. Improving shooting accuracy,
   positioning, and offensive decision-making could significantly increase their scoring
   output.

2. **High Turnovers (9)**  
   Player D has one of the highest turnover counts. With only 1 assist and low offensive
   contribution overall (goals + assists = 6), these turnovers are especially costly. This
   indicates issues in ball-handling, decision-making under pressure, or passing choices.

Given the combination of **extremely low production** and **high error frequency**, Player D
shows the largest gap between current performance and potential improvement. Targeted
coaching could meaningfully reduce their mistakes while raising their offensive impact.
